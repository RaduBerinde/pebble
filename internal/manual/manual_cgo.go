// observe concurrent memory access to memory allocated by this package.

// Note that we must either perform ALL allocations made by this package using
// Go or none of them. We sometimes store a pointer to a buffer allocated by
// this package (eg, a block) in a struct also allocated by this package (a
// block cache entry). The CGo pointer passing rules require that only pinned Go
